## Stage 2 (Readout heating rate)

### Data analysis

For analysing the MCP and MTS data from the reader to produce the readout heating rate results.

### Glow curves

For producing the MCP and MTS glow curves for each HR.

The format for this set of glowcurves is unique from the rest due to the varying readout times for each heating rate. 

### Reader profiles

Used in the methodology to show the different readout heating rates tested.
The data of _reader.xlsx_ was created manually.
